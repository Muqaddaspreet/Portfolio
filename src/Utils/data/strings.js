    description:
      "An audio ML project exploring three neural architectures—FNN/MLP, CNN, and RNN with LSTMs—to reduce short, sudden noises (claps, coughs, clicks) in speech. Using Mel-spectrogram features, the models learn to predict clean audio or ideal ratio masks and are evaluated with SNR improvement, MSE, PESQ, and STOI. The repo includes runnable notebooks, a research paper, and a slide deck summarizing methods and results.",
