- **Transient Noise Reduction**: This project explores three deep neural network (DNN) approaches to mitigating transient noise: Multi-Layer Perceptron / Feed-Forward Network (FNN/MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM units. Each approach is trained and tested on speech samples artificially corrupted with transient noise under varying conditions. Evaluation considers improvements in speech intelligibility and quality using objective and perceptual measures. Dataset: Primary Speech Data: CSTR VCTK Corpus, containing recordings of over 100 speakers with varied accents. Results- RNN provides strong improvements while maintaining efficient inference and memory usage. FNN trains quickly and can achieve good speech quality outcomes. CNN captures local time-frequency patterns but can struggle with unpredictable transient noise compared to RNN.
